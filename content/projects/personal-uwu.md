The Personal UwU is a joke chrome extension that I made after a friend (Jared Barker) gave my $5 dollars to do it. It pops up an uwu face when clicked which can be interacted and played with. The extension is essentially a virtual pet.

These are it's main features:
- The face's eyes will follow your cursor
- Giving the face a rub will make it gradually turn red
- Then when clicked, the face will make an uwu sound with it being louder the more red the face is
- And if you get the face to max redness, a special base boosted uwu sound will play

At one point the extension had over 300 users (somehow) but at the time of writing this, the extension only has around 120 :(

Personal UwU is available for download on chrome from the [web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/personal-uwu/jelenkibbchjbpojbmnehknglfnjgmhb) and the source code for the extension can be found [here](https://github.com/marcusoosthuizen/personal-uwu) but be warned, it is a very messy repo.
