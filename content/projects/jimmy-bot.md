Jimmy is a Discord bot written in python that allows for a minecraft server to be started and stopped from within a discord server. It can also list all the players currently online on the server and works with [DiscordSRV](https://docs.discordsrv.com/), a plugin that bridges a discord channel with the in-game server chat.

The bot was originally made to manage my own minecraft server, but since the source code is available ([here](https://github.com/marcusoosthuizen/jimmy-bot)), anyone can use it for their own minecraft server if they wish.

*update: it now works with hytale too! Check out the github for more up to date info*
