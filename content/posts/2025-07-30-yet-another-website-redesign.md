Congrats to the person who cared enough to visit not only my website, but this "blog" post as well!

I have yet again updated my site and will be continuing to add stuff to it over the next couple of days. As of writing this, I have cleaned up a bunch of the pages and swapped out the base theme of the site to use [cactus theme](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus). As I continue to change stuff, I will update this page.

Fixed up the tags page and broken titles on some pages. The writings and projects pages look nicer as well.

New site theme :D

### Edit (06/08/2025)
I have added new links in the nav bar that lead to my youtube and goodread pages. There is also a fancy new about me page. 

There is something hidden there...
