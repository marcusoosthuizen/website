In november I got to go to the land of the rising sun! Here are some photos from the trip.

We start in Tokyo...

# Kagoshima

Kagoshima was probably the highlight of the trip so there are a bunch of photos for this city. This is also the point where I realised I had been taking photos in 4:3 instead of 16:9.
