I have completely rewritten my discord bot Jimmy so that he can not only control Minecraft servers, but now Hytale servers as well. All documentation and code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/marcusoosthuizen/jimmy-bot).

**NOTE:** if you plan on using this for your own servers, there may be a bit of manual tweaking needeed to get it to work on your setup. It's not a simple plug and play script.
