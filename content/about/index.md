# About Me
Hello! I am Marcus Oosthuizen (as you have probably guessed) and I am currently in my second year of study at university, completing my bachelor's degree in computer science. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing the piano, programming, playing nintendo games and running (sometimes). This website was built to share anything interesting I'm doing or working on.
