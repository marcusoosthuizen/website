the hugo code used for compiling my website

just install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and then run `hugo serve` in the project directory to serve the webpage or run `hugo` to compile the site into static html which can then be then found in the public/ directory

or just visit https://marcusoosthuizen.com. It's a lot easier then doing all of that ;)
